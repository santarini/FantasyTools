# Fantasy Tools

Our fantasy basketball league moved from ESPN to Yahoo. Yahoo doesn't seem to offer as much data as ESPN did on players. One of the obvious metrics that are important for determining ideal fantasy lineups is the number of games scheduled for each player each week. This data point is not readily available in the Yahoo fantasy interface. Manually finding the number of games each player on a team has scheduled has proven to tedious.

YahooBballFantasy.py will seek to automate the process. Having this information should provide a significant advantage over lesser informed leaguemates.
